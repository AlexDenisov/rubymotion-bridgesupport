Installation
============

On SnowLeopard and later:

make
sudo make install

This will build 64-bit (x86_64) by default.  To build both 32 and 64-bit:

make RC_ARCHS='i386 x86_64'

To install to a different partition than the root partition or to a
subdirectory:

sudo make install DESTDIR=/Volumes/Other
